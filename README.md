## Project Overview

### Northwind Database Setup

To start working with the Northwind database:

1. **Import the Database**:
   - Use the `northwind.postgre.sql` file to import the Northwind schema and data into your PostgreSQL server.
   - You can do this by executing the SQL file using a PostgreSQL client or command line tool:

     ```bash
     psql -U your_username -d your_database -f northwind.postgre.sql
     ```

2. **Verify the Import**:
   - Ensure that the Northwind database is correctly imported by checking the tables and data.

### Practice Queries

The **50 Northwind Practice Queries.pdf** contains a set of advanced SQL exercises designed to test and enhance your SQL skills. Each query in this document is intended to challenge you and help you gain a deeper understanding of SQL.

### Solution Documentation

The **Northwind exercise answer** directory includes images showing the answers to each of the queries in the **50 Northwind Practice Queries.pdf**. The answers are organized to match the query numbers in the PDF for easy reference.
